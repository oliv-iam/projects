The directory contains the Python files exact.py and sampling.py, as well as the notebook eval.ipynb.

Both the exact and sampling-based algorithms are possible to run directly, as
./exact.py <thres> <path/to/dataset>
./sampling.py <ssize> <dsize> <delta> <thres> <path/to/dataset>
Or you can use the methods 'exact' and 'sampling' from the exact and sampling modules with the same arguments as above.

The notebook eval.ipynb contains my report (with code, plots, evaluation) and should be pretty self-explanatory.

Datasets from http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/ not included.
